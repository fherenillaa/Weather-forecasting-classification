# üå¶Ô∏è Weather Forecasting and BBQ Suitability Classification using LSTM, XGBoost, and SVM

This project applies time series **forecasting** and **binary classification** techniques to weather data‚Äîfocusing specifically on **temperature mean (`tempmean`)** and **precipitation (`precip`)**‚Äîusing Python and Jupyter Notebooks. The goal is to predict weather trends and classify each day as either **suitable for a BBQ (`True`)** or **not suitable (`False`)** based on forecasted conditions.

## üìÅ Dataset Description

This dataset was created for machine learning and deep learning training purposes. It is suitable for **regression**, **classification**, and **forecasting** tasks. The dataset is complex enough to illustrate real-world challenges such as **overfitting**, **seasonality**, and **imbalanced classes**, while remaining intuitively accessible.

### üîó Source Acknowledgment

The original weather data was obtained from:

> **European Climate Assessment & Dataset (ECA&D)**  
> File created on: 22-04-2021  
> Official site: [http://www.ecad.eu](http://www.ecad.eu)

## üéØ Target Labels

After forecasting temperature and precipitation, the model classifies each day into one of the following binary labels:

- **`True`** ‚Äî Suitable for BBQ (e.g., warm temperature, low precipitation)
- **`False`** ‚Äî Not Suitable for BBQ (e.g., rain, cold, or high humidity)

These labels are derived using rule-based thresholds on the predicted values, such as:
- `tempmean` above a comfortable threshold (e.g., 22¬∞C)
- `precip` below a tolerable limit (e.g., 1 mm)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methods Used

### üîÆ Forecasting Models
- **LSTM** (Long Short-Term Memory Neural Network)
- **XGBoost** (Extreme Gradient Boosting)

### üß† Classification Model
- **SVM** (Support Vector Machine)

Forecasting models are used to predict future weather values (`tempmean`, `precip`). The classification model (SVM) then evaluates the forecasted values and assigns a binary BBQ suitability label.

## üìà Results Overview

| Target     | Forecasting Models | Classification Model |
|------------|--------------------|----------------------|
| tempmean   | LSTM, XGBoost      | SVM                  |
| precip     | LSTM, XGBoost      | SVM                  |

Model performance is evaluated using:
- **RMSE** for forecasting accuracy
- **Classification Accuracy**, **Confusion Matrix** for BBQ suitability classification
